  - implemented in: a client and a server program exchaging HTTP messages in-btw
  - defines the structure of these messages and how the client and server exchange the messages

(review of terminologies)
- web page(document)
  - a base HTML file refers to objects(files)
  - URL: the hostname of the server having the object + pathname of the object
- web browser = client
- web server = server: housing web objects referred by URLs

- how does a client request a web page from a server and the server responds to this?
