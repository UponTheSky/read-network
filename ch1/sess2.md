# The Network Edge
- end systems(sit at the edge of the Internet) = hosts(hosting application programs)
- client vs server

## 1. Access Networks
- **access network**: the network that physically connects an end system to the first router

### home access: DSL, cable, FTTH, 5G fixed wireless
- how homes connect to the Internet
- **DSL**(digital subscriber line): sharing existing telephone line with different signal frequencies
  - splitter(home), DSLAM(DSL access multiplexer)(telephone companies' local central office)

- cable internet access: using existing cable infrastructure provided by a cable TV company
  - cable modem, ethernet port(home) / CMTS(cable modem termination system)
  - shared broadcast medium: data flow is shared => data speed, collision issues

- **FTTH**(fiber to the home)
  - fibre from central office to homes, but splitted
  - **AON**(active optical networks) vs **PON**(passive optical networks)

- 5G fixed wireless: data is sent wirelessly from a provider's base station to a modem in the home

### access in the enterprise(and the home): ethernet and wifi
- **LAN**(local area network): on corporate, campuses, home settings => ethernet
  - ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to a ethernet switch
  - this switch is then connected to another routers led to the Internet

- wireless LAN settings
  - but in the middle, usually the enterprise's network is wired ethernet, which then is connected to the wired Internet
  - WIFI

- home network: broadband residential access + wireless LAN technologies
  - base station: the wireless access point for devices
  - home router: connects the wireless access point and other wired home devices to the Internet

### wide-area wireless access: 3G, LTE 4G, 5G
- mobile devices use the same wireless infrastructure to exchange packets through a base station operated by the cellular network provider
- unlike WIFI, virtually no limit of distance
